# Notion Integration System

Organizing, managing and documenting with an extended palette of tools.

## The Problem

It happens to be quite a chore creating notes and other documents in the relatively immutable and slow (on Big Data) editor Notion. Every time you create relations the editor tends to take up quite some time just for searching the database. This can cost you a lot of time and sometimes even your idea you just wanted to store and forget about in the first place. The reason for these long load times are the quickly scaling databases.

## The Solution

A system that retrieves data from notion and other third-party tools/services/systems and stores the data in a database. By doing so you have full control of all the properties these entities have and can archive the data in a separate database for optimum performance on the notion-side surface.
