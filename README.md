# What it does

On May 13, 2021 Notion released an official version of their API which makes it possible to retrieve your Notion-Data and use it in other Applications or implement features and automation-routines that are not currently supported by the editor itself.

## The Problem

Notion on its own is great, but certain activites like creating a proper schedule is as of now still quite laborious. Applications like Microsoft TODO and Google Calendar are better at certain tasks but it also sucks if you are required to create the same events in multiple applications.

## The Solution

That is why I decided to make use of the new api in order to sync my calendar data with my notion-databases.

## Dev Environment

```
npm run dev
```

<!-- ## Execute the Project

> I assume npm was installed correctly and it's environment-variables are set

> I also assume bash is being used

### Execute the Google Drive Project

Simply execute the following command in order to start the Webserver.

```
npm start
```

### Execute the Github Project(Production branch)

Clone the GitHub repository with `git clone`.

```
git clone https://github.com/ungarmichael/octagon-landing.git
```
```
cd octagon-landing
```

For installing all necessary dependencies run:

```
npm i
```

For creating a production-version of the project run:

```
npm run build
```

For starting the server(production version):
```
npm start
```

Now the Project can be viewed on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Further Project Details

### Design
The Mockup was created using Figma and can be viewed [here](https://www.figma.com/file/7gjL6YkZ6Yg5CegX9p9AZ9/Landing-Page?node-id=0%3A1).

Illustrations where copied from [undraw.co](https://undraw.co) and  [vecteezy.com](https://es.vecteezy.com) and manipulated according to the scenario by myself using [affinity designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/designer/), [affinity photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/photo/) and for certain use-cases [adobe illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html).
